Conclusion
===================================


The main contribution of this projects are as follows:

- A DAG pipline is bulit using Luigi to separate the tasks

- Different isolated environments are built for different packages to avoid dependency hell

- Salted Graphs are used for output of different tasks to avoid data-dependency hell

- An easy to use workflow is established to run an ML code partly on a cluster and partly on a local machine
